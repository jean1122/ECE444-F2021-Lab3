###### Improvements on Education Pathways course planning website:  
The functional requirement that I think should be improved is to be able to search function of the website. When I was trying to search for one of the required courses in software engineering stream in Computer Engineering called "Operating System," I can't find this course from Education Pathways. However, when I searched the word "operating," the operating system course from Computer Science department showed up. To resolve this problem, I think it would be better to include the function to search by course name and course code, and improve the accuracy of the search function.

The non-functional requirement that I think should be improved is the user interface. It is very hard to know about the course description from the search result list because there are no breaks between different result. To resolve this problem, I think it would be nice to add margins to the website and color-coded different result so it is easier to differentiate different results.
